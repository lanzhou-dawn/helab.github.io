title: The Two-Component System RstA/RstB Regulates Expression of Multiple Efflux Pumps and Influences Anaerobic Nitrate Respiration in Pseudomonas fluorescens

## ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps are involved in bacterial intrinsic resistance to multiple antimicrobials. Expression of MDR efflux pumps can be either constitutive or transiently induced by various environmental signals, which are typically perceived by bacterial two-component systems (TCSs) and relayed to the bacterial nucleoid, where gene expression is modulated for niche adaptation. Here, we demonstrate that RstA/RstB, a TCS previously shown to control acid-induced and biofilm-related genes in Escherichia coli, confers resistance to multiple antibiotics in Pseudomonas fluorescens by directly regulating the MDR efflux pumps EmhABC and MexCD-OprJ. Moreover, we show that phosphorylation of the conserved Asp52 residue in RstA greatly enhances RstA-DNA interaction, and regulation of the multidrug resistance by RstA/RstB is dependent on the phosphorylation of the RstA Asp52 residue by RstB. Proteome analysis reveals RstA/RstB also positively regulates the efflux pump MexEF-OprN and enzymes involved in anaerobic nitrate respiration and pyoverdine biosynthesis. Our results suggest that, by coupling the expression of multiple efflux pumps and anaerobic nitrate respiration, RstA/RstB could play a role in defense against nitrosative stress caused by anaerobic nitrate respiration.
IMPORTANCE Microenvironmental hypoxia typically increases bacterial multidrug resistance by elevating expression of multidrug efflux pumps, but the precise mechanism is currently not well understood. Here, we showed that the two-component system RstA/RstB not only positively regulated expression of several efflux pumps involved in multidrug resistance, but also promoted expression of enzymes involved in anaerobic nitrate respiration and pyoverdine biosynthesis. These results suggested that, by upregulating expression of efflux pumps and pyoverdine biosynthesis-related enzymes, RstA/RstB could play a role in promoting bacterial tolerance to hypoxia by providing protection against nitrosative stress.
